  abstract  = {Emergence of cloud computing and service oriented architecture has created a great impact on the development of microservice architecture (MSA) which is suitable for cloud infrastructure. MSA is a light weight process running in its own way and resulting a single application. The target for developing MSA is high degree higher flexibility and modularity. In this paper key features of microservices are described along with the architecture model of microservices. Microservices principles and their pros and cons are elaborated. Microservices are well suited for complex application like web based application and enterprise application.},
