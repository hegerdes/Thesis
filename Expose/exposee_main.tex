\section{Topic, Content and Structure}
The following sections describe the general topic, current state of it and the concept of the bachelor thesis.
\subsection{Topic}
With the continuing shift towards microservices in the software industry, more and more new tools are being developed to operate, scale and maintain services. The microservice culture stipulates that new features are delivered faster and thereby more frequent to customers, bringing developers and administrators closer together. The resulting principals for this short, agile development cycle are combined under the concept of DevOps. While analyses, guidelines and experiences for the production operation of DevOps are available extensively, the benefits of their toolset for the use in development environments have hardly been analyzed yet.\newline
Individual development environments are quiet unique for every developer, reflect personal preferences and are often time-consuming and complex to setup. Microservices and DevOps tools can help to instantly set up a consistent development environments and yet provide the freedom to let developers use the preferred applications. Companies like Docker Inc. and GitHub/Microsoft are pushing this concept forward with products like Dev-Containers and CodeSpaces as well. These allow users to quickly checkout code form any location, even within a browser, to test and apply changes to their applications.
\subsection{Goal}
The goal of this bachelor thesis is to provide a basic overview of the microservice world and the usage of their tools for a modern DevOps development environment. There will be a description of the tools that are practically suitable to be used in a development environment alongside with the creation of a practical container-based developer environment example. The advantages and disadvantages of such an environment will be discussed and analyzed. If possible, a small evaluation based on practical experience will also be part of the thesis.
\subsection{Research status}
The educational resources about microservice are widely available. (A search on GoogleScolar shows about 14k results). While the used tools consistently evolve, the basic concept is not considered new anymore. A report published in 2020 by Mike Loukides and Steve Swoyer show that over 75\% of the companies surveyed have adopted some microservice tools in the last five years.\cite{msadoption}
On the other hand, technical journals about the use of these tools in developments are rather rare. Papers that exist focus primarily on the \acl*{CI} process. There are some internet blog entries with exemplary web-development setups using Docker. However the actual progression in platform independent development environment setups are primarily driven by real practical applications currently developed by Miscrosoft, CodeSandbox BV. etc. and are not currently covert by journals.
\subsection{Concept}
The increasing demand and complexity of software, alongside with more frequent feature requests in the software industry, resulted in creation and adoption of microservices. This trend continues with the broader availability of containerization solutions and tools. Containerization allows software to be independent of the host environment that runs the code. The container already ships with a pre- and well-defined runtime environment and therefore decouples the link between host and software. Multiple instances of a software can be deployed quickly and on demand without the need of tedious, time consuming and error-prone host configuration. However, these advantages bring also new challenges. Monolithic applications are developed and tested as one unit, components are tightly coupled so that errors in between components can be found quickly. Microservices are often orchestrated and provide together one extensive application. Changes in one service may break other parts of the application, which only becomes apparent during operation in the overall orchestrated system. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are two concepts, which are increasingly adopted, that try to solve this problem. The creation and practice of these concepts are bundled under the principles of DevOps culture. While there are already comprehensive guides and materials for implementing \ac{CI} and \ac{CD} in DevOps, these focus mostly on the process of testing and delivery. These resources fall short in the management of the development environment.\newline
Development environments are highly heterogeneous. Developers use different operating systems in various configurations, multiple versions of programming languages and their personal preferred tools. Further development environments have additional requirements like usage of demo data, source-maps, debug-symbols and opt-out security features. It is not uncommon that configuring such an environment time consuming. The fact that these development environments differ to the \ac{CI}/\ac{CD} builds may result in unexpected behavior. This bachelor thesis introduces the idea of using the same containerization approach and \ac{CI}/\ac{CD} pipeline to build well-defined development environments and evaluates the idea based on a practical example project.\newline
The process of describing, building, applying and discussing the usability of such a development environment will be the concept of this bachelor thesis. The concept is illustrated by means of an exemplary practical project,which illustrates potential problems and challenges.
\subsection{Motivation}
Development environments tend to be complex especially for larger projects. Many projects require a specific version of a compiler, interpreter, library and other parts of the toolchain. The specifics on how to set up these environments differ based on the (flavor of the) operating system. However, when developing on multiple projects, different versions of compiler, interpreter and library are often required which can lead to conflicts. The existence of package manager tools like \ac*{python-venv} and \ac{nvm}, that try so solve the problem of incompatible libraries, poofs that there is a need for dedicated clean project environments.\newline
Finally, setting up such an environment takes a lot of time and is a challenge, especially for new members of a project team. It may also act as an entry barrier in open source projects.\newline
Containerization is an approach to make applications independent of the host system and prevents configuration based errors. These concepts are promising to reduces the setup time of an application as well as to eliminate the before mentioned configuration errors. The approach of development containers makes it possible to quickly create a working development environment anywhere, even on a different host. The only thing the developer needs is an editor and a connection to that host. Services like codesandbox.io and GitHubs CodeSpaces are some of the first to implement these concepts for small projects.
